RQ: What is the impact of VSL on school absenteeism?


Asked the Following Questions

(a) Pre-treatment effect analysis (30 marks in total):
(i) Concisely present and describe any statistics you think are useful about the variables
in your data set.
(ii) Carry out and present balancing tests.
(iii) Note: you may find this useful to do (ai) and (aii) once you have completed your
regression analysis. That way you will have a better idea of what the useful points
actually are.
(b) Regression analysis and presentation of results (20 marks in total): In this section
do not comment on the regressions, just present them clearly such that a reader can interpret
them without having to refer to the main text. You can add 2 brief sentences of tables
notes as you will see in any journaled article. These table notes will not be included in the
word count.
(i) Estimate the following regression Days = α + βtreatment + ϵ for the sample of
all households in the endline data.
(ii) Estimate the following regression Days = α + βtreatment + ϵ for the sample of
only pro-government households in the endline data.

(iii) Present up to three further regressions of your choice. If could be less than
three if you wish, but not more.
(iv) Present all the regressions in a single table that is easily readable. For example,
on the paper we have seen on this module, see Table 6 on page 63 of Schofield (2015)
or Table VII on page 185 of Miguel and Kremer (2004). The papers are clearly in a
different context but the presentation of results is similar. You can find these papers
from the module outline on moodle: HERE. That is, a table of all the regressions where
the estimated regression coefficients and standard errors are presented by column.
(c) Discussion of results and further analysis:
(i) What is the answer to the research question? Discuss the regressions you have presented in the regression analysis. Interpret clearly the key regression results and
explain why you have run those particular regressions. (30 marks)
(ii) Suppose you wanted to extend the analysis: what other variables would you like
to have in the data set and why? (20 marks)
